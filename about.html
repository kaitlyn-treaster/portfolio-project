            Hello! My name is Kaitlyn Treaster. I'm a Front-end developer based in
            Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. When I was young, I loved to create things. Anything
            that I could get my hands on would be changed into something else. Then I 
            realized that I could create anything that I wanted on the computer. I went to
            college to study computer animation and 3D modeling. After college, I wanted to 
            add more tools to my toolbox along with everything that I learn from college. 
            I decided to learn how to be a developer so that I could continue learn how to
            build things in a different way then in a 3D world. Learning to code and develop 
            has been the best thing I could have learned. Seeing and learning how different
            pages and applications were and are made has been fun to learn. 
          </p>
